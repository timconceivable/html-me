                <h2>Childhood</h2>
                <p>
                I remember drawing a lot as a child.  When I wasn't drawing, 
                I was sculpting with Play-Dough or building with Legos.  When I 
                wasn't doing either of those, I was probably watching cartoons or 
                playing with action figures (G.I. Joe, Transformers, He-Man, etc).
                <br>
                I drew a lot though.  I started off like most do.  Stick figures, 
                then tanks, monster trucks, and other weird stuff boys are often into 
                at an early age.  I always did well in art class, and got a lot of 
                support from my art teachers and my parents.

                I remember clearly wanting to be an animator at Disney when I grew up 
                when I was in elementary school.  I loved Disney cartoons and films, 
                and did a report on Walt Disney at some point.  Then in fifth grade, 
                my friends got into comic books, and I was instantly hooked as well. 
                From then on, I wanted to draw comics.  I dreamed of working for Marvel 
                for a long time, and then maybe creating my own characters and book for 
                Image Comics.  I began copying images from comic books, and then start 
                creating my own characters.
                <br>
                Around sixth grade, I went on a trip with my family to Florida and Disney World.  
                On the way back we visited my mother's aunt and uncle in Savannah, GA.  
                My great uncle saw that I liked to draw, and he just happened to have a copy 
                of <strong><i>'How To Draw Comics The Marvel Way'</i></strong>, and it forever changed my life.
                My mother had gotten me a great book on cartooning prior to that 
                (Preston Blair's <i>'Animation'</i>), but 'The Marvel Way' gave me a whole new 
                <strong>prespective</strong> on drawing.

                <h2>High School</h2>
                <p>
                By the time I was in high school, I was drawing every day.  In class, out 
                of class; it didn't matter.  I doodled on my homework assignments and on 
                scrap paper.  Drawing actually helped me focus on lectures.
                <br>
                I took art classes every semester through high school: drawing, painting, 
                sculpture, graphic design, printmaking, and AP art as well.  I was not the 
                best student though.  As much as I loved art, I did not like doing assignments. 
                I actually failed my sculpture class because I just stopped being interested in 
                the work, and I had to drop AP art after a semester because I wasn't finishing 
                my projects. Perfectionism got the best of me, and it became a problem I have 
                struggled with my entire life since.

                <p>
                Despite that, I kept drawing.  I contributed sketches and short stories to a 
                school creative writing publication.  I had my mind set on studying art in 
                college as well, and I applied to a few art colleges and got accepted.  I chose 
                to go to Savannah College of Art and Design because 1. it was far away from home, 
                and I liked the city; and 2. they had a program in Sequential Art (comics).

                <p>
                I have certainly felt lost for a long time, but I'm happy to have 
                had the experiences I have had.  It's been an intersting journey, and 
                I think that can only help make my creative output more interesting.  
                I am also really happy to have finally discovered programming, and that 
                I can make video games.  I was focused on art for so long that it never 
                occurred to me that I could do this kind of thing. <br>
                Life is full of surprises.
